 * @brief Legacy 8259 PIC driver — disables the PIC in favor of the APIC.
 *
 * What is the PIC?
 *
 *   The 8259A PIC is legacy interrupt controller hardware dating back to the
 *   original IBM PC (1981). It routes hardware interrupts from devices (keyboard,
 *   timer, disk, etc.) to the CPU. The original PC had one PIC with 8 IRQ lines;
 *   the AT added a second "slave" PIC cascaded through IRQ 2, giving 15 usable IRQs.

 *
 * Why Do We Disable It?
 *
 *   Modern x86-64 systems use the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)
 *   instead. The APIC is far more capable:
 *     - Supports more than 15 IRQs (up to 224 interrupt vectors)
 *     - Required for multi-core/multi-processor systems
 *     - Supports MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) for PCIe devices
 *     - Better priority handling and interrupt routing
 *
 *   However, the legacy PIC still exists for backwards compatibility and can
 *   generate spurious interrupts if not properly disabled. We disable it by
 *   masking all IRQ lines (writing 0xFF to both data ports), which tells the
 *   PIC to ignore all interrupt requests.
 *
 *   After this, we use the Local APIC and I/O APIC exclusively for interrupts.
 *
 * The Ports:
 *
 *   PIC1 (Master): Command = 0x20, Data = 0x21
 *   PIC2 (Slave):  Command = 0xA0, Data = 0xA1
 *
 *   Writing 0xFF to the data port sets the Interrupt Mask Register (IMR) to
 *   mask (disable) all 8 IRQ lines on that PIC.
